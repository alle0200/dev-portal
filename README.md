# [Allie's Dev Portal]

A dev portal built out of the custom boilerplate I made earlier in the semester. It has links to all of the other projects I've completeed. Most notably, it links to the following:
* My GitHub Page
* My Zsh Bash Me Assignment
* My Commitment Assignment
* Our Exquisite Corpse Project
* My Custom Boilerplate
* My Parallax Narrative
* My Google Analytics
* My Creative Project
